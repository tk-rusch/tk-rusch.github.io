  abstract={The design of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
to accurately process sequential inputs with longtime dependencies is very challenging on account
of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem.
To overcome this, we propose a novel RNN architecture which is based on a structure preserving
discretization of a Hamiltonian system of secondorder ordinary differential equations that models
networks of oscillators. The resulting RNN is fast,
invertible (in time), memory efficient and we derive rigorous bounds on the hidden state gradients
to prove the mitigation of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. A suite of experiments
are presented to demonstrate that the proposed
RNN provides state of the art performance on a
variety of learning tasks with (very) long-time
dependencies.},
