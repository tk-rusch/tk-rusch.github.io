  abstract={The design of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
to accurately process sequential inputs with longtime dependencies is very challenging on account
of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem.
To overcome this, we propose a novel RNN architecture which is based on a structure preserving
discretization of a Hamiltonian system of secondorder ordinary differential equations that models
networks of oscillators. The resulting RNN is fast,
invertible (in time), memory efficient and we derive rigorous bounds on the hidden state gradients
to prove the mitigation of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. A suite of experiments
are presented to demonstrate that the proposed
RNN provides state of the art performance on a
variety of learning tasks with (very) long-time
dependencies.},

abstract={Circuits of biological neurons, such as in the functional parts of the brain can be modeled as networks of coupled oscillators. Inspired by the ability of these systems to express a rich set of outputs while keeping (gradients of) state variables bounded, we propose a novel architecture for recurrent neural networks. Our proposed RNN is based on a time-discretization of a system of second-order ordinary differential equations, modeling networks of controlled nonlinear oscillators. We prove precise bounds on the gradients of the hidden states, leading to the mitigation of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem for this RNN. Experiments show that the proposed RNN is comparable in performance to the state of the art on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of this architecture to provide stable and accurate RNNs for processing complex sequential data.},

that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard deep learning algorithms that are
based on randomly chosen training data, for problems in moderately high dimensions. The proposed

abstract={We present a novel algorithmic approach and an error analysis leveraging Quasi-Monte Carlo points for training deep neural network (DNN) surrogates of Data-to-Observable (DtO) maps in engineering design. Our analysis reveals higher-order consistent, deterministic choices of training points in the input data space for deep and shallow Neural Networks with holomorphic activation functions such as tanh. These novel training points are proved to facilitate higher-order decay (in terms of the number of training samples) of the underlying generalization error, with consistency error bounds that are free from the curse of dimensionality in the input data space, provided that DNN weights in hidden layers satisfy certain summability conditions. We present numerical experiments for DtO maps from elliptic and parabolic PDEs with uncertain inputs that confirm the theoretical analysis.},

abstract={In the conceptual and preliminary aircraft design phase the
Free-Form Deformation (FFD) is one of various parametrization
schemes to define the geometry of an engine’s nacelle. This paper
presents a method that is able to create a C2 continuous periodic
approximation of existing reference nacelles with the B-spline
based FFD, which is a generalization of the classical FFD. The
basic principle of this method is to start with a rotational symmetric B-spline approximation of the reference nacelle, which is
subsequently deformed with a FFD grid that is placed around
the initial geometry. A method is derived that computes the displacement of the FFD grid points, such that the deformed nacelle
approximates the reference nacelle with minimal deviations. As
this turns out to be a linear inverse problem, it can be solved with
a linear least squares fit. To avoid overfitting effects – like degenerative FFD grids which imply excessive local deformations
– the inverse problem is regularized with the Tikhonov approach.
The NASA CRM model and the IAE V2500 engine have been selected as reference geometries. Both resemble nacelles that are
typically found on common aircraft models and both deviate sufficiently from the rotational symmetry. It is demonstrated that the
mean error of the approximation decreases with an increase of
the number of FFD grid points and how the regularization affects
these results. Finally, the B-spline based FFD with the classical
Bernstein based FFD are compared for both models. The results conceptually prove the usability of the FFD approach for
the construction of nacelle geometries in the preliminary aircraft
design phase.},
