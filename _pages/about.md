I recently finished a PhD in Machine Learning / Applied Mathematics at **ETH Zurich**, advised by <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/sam/the-institute/people/siddhartha-mishra.html">Siddhartha Mishra</a>. 
Moreover, during my PhD studies I had a second affiliation at the EECS Department at **UC Berkeley**, advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/">Michael Mahoney</a>.

Before my PhD, I obtained a Master's degree in computational applied mathematics at the
**University of Edinburgh**, and before that I finished a Bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics at the **University of Bonn**.
