My name is T. Konstantin Rusch and I'm a postdoctoral researcher at **CSAIL, MIT** 
working with <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/daniela-rus">Daniela Rus</a>.
Before that I finished a PhD in Machine Learning / Applied Mathematics at **ETH Zurich**, 
where I was lucky enough to get advised by <a href="https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html">Siddhartha Mishra</a>. 
Moreover, during my PhD studies I had a second affiliation at the EECS Department at **UC Berkeley**, 
advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/">Michael Mahoney</a>.

<br>
My main research interest is in combining physics with machine learning. 
Thereby, I focus on **physics-inspired machine learning**, which can be described 
as leveraging structure from physical systems to construct novel machine 
learning methods with better inductive biases. Additionally, I work 
on combining methods from numerical analysis with machine learning 
to solve problems in computational science and engineering.
