I recently defended my doctoral dissertation in Machine Learning / Applied Mathematics at **ETH Zurich**.
I was advised by <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/sam/the-institute/people/siddhartha-mishra.html"> Siddhartha Mishra </a>. 
Moreover, during my PhD studies I had a second affiliation at the EECS Department at **UC Berkeley**, advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/"> Michael Mahoney </a>.

<br>
Before I started my PhD at ETH Zurich, I obtained my Master's degree in computational applied mathematics at 
**The University of Edinburgh**, and before that I finished my Bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics at the **University of Bonn**.
