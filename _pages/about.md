My name is T. Konstantin Rusch and I'm a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL, MIT</a>.
In 2023, I finished a PhD in Machine Learning / Applied Mathematics at **ETH Zurich**, advised by <a href="https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html">Siddhartha Mishra</a>. 
Moreover, during my PhD studies I had a second affiliation at the EECS Department at **UC Berkeley**, advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/">Michael Mahoney</a>.
