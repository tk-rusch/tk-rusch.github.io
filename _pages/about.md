My name is T. Konstantin Rusch and I'm a PhD student in applied mathematics at **ETH Zurich**, supervised by <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/sam/the-institute/people/siddhartha-mishra.html"> Siddhartha Mishra </a>.
<br>
My research focuses on physics-based machine learning, where I'm interested in both, using physical priors to construct new methods which can be applied in classical machine learning domains (e.g. time-series prediction, speech recognition and NLP), as well as 
leveraging machine learning methods to solve scientific problems (e.g. solving physical systems modeled by PDEs). The goal of my research is to combine both directions by constructing new state-of-the-art machine learning methods using physical priors to solve scientific problems.

Before I started my PhD at ETH Zurich, I obtained my Master's degree in computational applied mathematics at **The University of Edinburgh**, and before that I finished my Bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics at the **University of Bonn**.
