My name is T. Konstantin Rusch and I'm a postdoctoral researcher at **CSAIL, MIT** 
advised by <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/daniela-rus">Daniela Rus</a>.
Before that I finished a PhD in Machine Learning / Applied Mathematics at **ETH Zurich**, 
advised by <a href="https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html">Siddhartha Mishra</a>. 
Moreover, during my PhD studies I had a second affiliation at the EECS Department at **UC Berkeley**, 
advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/">Michael Mahoney</a>.

I am a computational applied mathematician focused on AI research. Much of my work takes inspirations 
from physics and neuroscience to develop novel state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. 
My research is deeply grounded in computational science and statistics, providing rigorous 
mathematical insights. 
My main application area is in robotics; one of my goals is to achieve physical intelligence, 
which requires the development of new models that allow robots to interact safely and efficiently 
with their environments.
