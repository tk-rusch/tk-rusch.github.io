My name is T. Konstantin Rusch and I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at **ETH Zurich**, supervised by <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/sam/the-institute/people/siddhartha-mishra.html"> Prof. Dr. Siddhartha Mishra </a>, 
with a second affiliation at the EECS Department at **UC Berkeley**, supervised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/"> Prof. Dr. Michael Mahoney </a>.
My main research interest is in combining physics with machine learning. 
Thereby, I focus on physics-inspired machine learning, which can be described as leveraging structure of physical systems to construct novel machine learning algorithms with a better inductive bias. 
Moreover, I work on advancing methods from numerical analysis with machine learning to solve problems in computational science and engineering.
<br>
Before I started my PhD at ETH Zurich, I obtained my Master's degree in computational applied mathematics at 
**The University of Edinburgh**, and before that I finished my Bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics at the **University of Bonn**.
