**New preprint** (*joint work with UC Berkeley*) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04744.pdf"> Long Expressive Memory for Sequence Modeling </a>: 
A novel method for sequence modeling based on multiscale ODEs that is provably able to learn very long-term dependencies while being sufficiently expressive to outperform state-of-the-art recurrent sequence models.
