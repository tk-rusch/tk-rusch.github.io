**We organize a workshop at ICLR 2023**: Together with colleagues from Berkeley, Google, Twitter, ETH and Microsoft Research
we are organizing a workshop on <a href="https://physics4ml.github.io/"> Physics for Machine Learning</a>. 
We invite submissions on machine learning methods with a physics-based inductive bias.
